# another-dice-game
my first written C# program, go easy one me :-)

Short:
How many times do you have to roll your dice untill you reach a number of your choice.

program will ask for a number between 2 and 12
if correct
  then it wil display your choice
else
  in red will say that you didn't pay attention and will return to prevous question

after displaying you choice it wil run a random of 2 dices until the program reaches the value of your choice.

at the end the program will ask if you want to do that again
if y
  clear the console and restart the program
else
  a goodby message and closing of program in a few seconds...
